## Background

Our challenge for week 10 of coding boot camp was to create a Node.j command-line application that takes in information about employees on a fictional software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Unit tests for each segment of code must be provided.

## User Story

AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input,
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information,
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.

WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML,
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.

WHEN I click on the GitHub username,
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab,

WHEN I start the application,
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.

WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number,
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.

WHEN I select the engineer option,
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.

WHEN I select the intern option,
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.

WHEN I decide to finish building my team,
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.

## Tests

Use of npm Jest module for tests against employee functionality.
